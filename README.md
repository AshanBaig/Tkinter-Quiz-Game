# Quiz Game with Tkinter

Welcome to the Quiz Game built using Python's Tkinter library!

This interactive quiz game features multiple-choice questions covering various general knowledge topics. Players can use lifelines such as 50/50 and help to aid them in answering questions and earn money based on correct responses.

## Features

- **Multiple-choice Questions**: Engage with a variety of questions covering diverse topics.
- **Lifelines**: Utilize lifelines like 50/50 and help to assist in answering questions effectively.
- **Earn Money**: Accumulate money based on correct answers and progress through the game.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Enjoy a simple and intuitive interface designed using Tkinter.

## Game Mechanics

- Upon launching the game, players are presented with multiple-choice questions.
- Lifelines such as 50/50 and help can be used to aid in answering questions.
- Correct answers lead to the accumulation of money.
- The game ends after all questions have been answered or if the player chooses to exit.

## Game Flow

1. Launch the game by running the Python script.
2. Answer multiple-choice questions by selecting the appropriate option.
3. Use lifelines strategically to improve your chances of answering correctly.
4. Accumulate money based on correct answers.
5. Progress through the game and enjoy the interactive experience!

## Improvements

To enhance efficiency, the game automatically removes two wrong options when using the 50/50 lifeline. Additionally, the help option removes one wrong option. In some fortunate instances, using both lifelines simultaneously may remove all three wrong options, providing players with an advantage.
